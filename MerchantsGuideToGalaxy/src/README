Instructions
-----------------------------------

This program/assignment can be executed or verified using three methods as specified below:

Method 1: Running from console.
---------------------------------

1. Import the package into any IDE.
2. Run the program Start.java without any program arguments. 
	2.a This will make the program assume interactive console mode. Follow instructions printed on console.
	2.b Console reads number of conversations first followed by those many number of conversations.
	2.c You can evaluate any number of valid queries on the console. Type 'exit' to exit the console mode. 

Method 2: Running from an input text file.
------------------------------------------

1. Import the package into any IDE.
2. Run the program Start.java with exactly one argument: absolute path to the input file. 
	2.a: This will make program assume file input mode and it will print output without any intervention.
	2.b: RESTRICTION: Note that input file should contain both conversations and queries. Queries should start with 'how' or 'what' and follow structure mentioned in section "Dependencies"
	
Method 3: Running the JUnit test
---------------------------------

1. Import the package into any IDE with JUnit plugin.
2. Run the JUnit test suite TestMerchantsGuide.java. Modify queries and conversation in appropriate test methods as suitable.

Dependencies
------------

1. In console mode, conversations are read first and then queries.
2. In input file mode, conversations and queries can be in any order as long as queries start with 'how' or 'what'.
3. All conversations should have the word 'is' to create value mapping.
4. Simple conversations i.e. conversations providing direct mapping should have below structure:
		<simple-key> is <value>
5. Complex conversations i.e. conversations providing indirect value mapping must follow below structure:
		<simple-key1> <simple-key2> <complex-key> is <value> credits.
